# PlantUML Diagrams

This directory contains the PlantUML source code and vector graphics of important parts
of ICON. The diagrams were generated using the 
[PlantUML software](https://plantuml.com/download).

If you are using VSCode, you can use [this plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml)
to add support for PlantUML.

With neovim, I am using [nvim-soil](https://github.com/javiorfo/nvim-soil) and
[plantuml-syntax](https://github.com/aklt/plantuml-syntax).

You can also try it out on either of the following websites:

- [PlantUML](https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/)
- [PlantText](https://www.planttext.com/)
