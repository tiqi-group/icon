The experiments page shows a list of experiments on the left. This list is parsed from the experiment library ICON connects to.
When you click on an experiment, you will be greeted with the scan interface on the top. This allows you to define parameters you want to scan, the priority of the scan (number between 1 and 20), the number of shots for each data point, and the number of scan repetitions.

On the bottom, you will get the display groups defined for the experiment (instance). These are either local parameters (i.e. parameters scoped to the experiment instance), global parmaeters (i.e. parameters that) or device parameters
