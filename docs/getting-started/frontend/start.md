On the **start page**, you are greeted with a status overview of three core components:

* **InfluxDB database**
* **Hardware**
* **Devices**

Each entry includes a shortcut for configuration or navigation:

* For **InfluxDB** and **hardware**, an *edit* icon is provided. Clicking it takes you to the [settings page](./settings.md), where you can update their configuration.
* For the **devices** table, a link is provided that takes you directly to the [devices page](./devices.md).
